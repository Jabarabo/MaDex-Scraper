## MaDex Scraper
After the new update to MangaDex I was unable to find a good solution to downloading the scanlations from the site, so we wrote one.
This is a console-based tool for downloading and converting manga from MangaDex into a local PDF file for archival and later use.
It only works for MangaDex, nothing else.

Installation
--------------
1. Download the .exe (or build it yourself, your choice).
2. Run the program.
3. Follow on screen instructions.
4. Profit


No dependencies, so no need to worry about installing 3rd party tools.
